A lightweight mod that attempts to make it easier to see whats going on during bossfights.

V1.1.2:
-Added localization files for all in-game languages via a translator app.

V1.1.1:
-Added option to disable vanilla screen shake effects.
-Fixed bug with correctly detecting the max projectile size for highlighting.

V1.1:
-Greatly improved enemy projectile highlighting system, with options for different styles of highlights.
-Added optional function to disable background wall drawing.

This mod can:
-Add a line that connects the player to the cursor to help with aiming.
-Make friendly projectiles transparent or totally invisible to reduce visual clutter. (optionally overwrites drawing of said projectiles to fully kill off any effects that don't get removed by simple opacity tweaks)
-Highlight enemy projectiles to make them easier to see.
-Reduce frequency of vanilla particles/dust (or fully disable them).
-Disable background wall drawing to improve visibility and performance in wall-dense areas.
-Disable vanilla screen shake effects.

All features can be set individually to only turn on during bossfights, and can be toggled by keybinds at any time.

Incredibly customizable, pretty much every part of this mod can be adjusted to your liking.
