A lightweight mod that attempts to make it easier to see whats going on during bossfights.

This mod can:
Add a line that connects the player to the cursor to help with aiming.
Make friendly projectiles transparent or totally invisible to reduce visual clutter. (optionally overwrites drawing of said projectiles to fully kill off any effects that don't get removed by simple opacity tweaks)
Highlight enemy projectiles to make them easier to see.
Reduce frequency of vanilla particles/dust (or fully disable them).

All features can be set individually to only turn on during bossfights, and can be toggled by keybinds at any time.

Incredibly customizable, pretty much every part of this mod can be adjusted to your liking.

Please report any issues to the github page. Also open to any ideas for improvements.
