[h3]A lightweight mod that attempts to make it easier to see whats going on during bossfights, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.[/h3]

Also if you constantly lose your cursor in the middle of fights (I know you do), this is for you <3

This mod can:
[list]
[*]Add a line that connects the player to the cursor to help with aiming.
[*]Make friendly projectiles transparent or totally invisible to reduce visual clutter. (optionally overwrites drawing of said projectiles to fully kill off any effects that don't get removed by simple opacity tweaks)
[*]Optionally hide only other players projectiles and summons.
[*]Highlight enemy projectiles to make them easier to see.
[*]Reduce frequency of vanilla particles/dust (or fully disable them).
[*]Disable background wall drawing to improve visibility and performance in wall-dense areas.
[*]Disable vanilla screen shake effects.
[/list]

All features can be set individually to only turn on during bossfights (on by default), and can be toggled by keybinds at any time.

Pretty much every part of this mod can be adjusted to your liking.
